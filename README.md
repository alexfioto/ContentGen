# **Project ContentGen**

## **Problem Statement:**

According to HubSpot companies spend 46% of their budget on content creation (HubSpot, 2017) and 24% of marketers plan on increasing their investment in content marketing in 2020 (HubSpot, 2020). Content creation is obviously a very important aspect of the overall marketing plan for company. There are usually a lot of moving pieces that go into creating an effective content marketing plan such as photographers, editors, videographers, models, writers, etc. With all of this being said, there is a faster approach to creating content at scale. That is through GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and natural language processing text transformers such as GPT-2.

Onto the second part of the project. This section of the project will enable a user of my application to pick a topic out of any of the topics available on Medium and my application will generate a 300 word body of text that they can use.
